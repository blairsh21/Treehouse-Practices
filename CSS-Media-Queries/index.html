            <h1>Welcome to CSS Wizards, Inc!</h1>
            <p>At CSS Wizards, Inc., we love to talk about CSS. In fact, you could say we’re a bit obsessed with all things Cascading Style Sheets.</p>
            <p>Our obsession began in 2011, when we founded this company out of our humble offices in Portland, Oregon. We’re pleased to celebrate our 10th anniversary in 2021.</p>
            <h2>Let’s Talk Media Queries.</h2>

            <p>You know what makes CSS even better? Media queries. If you’re not familiar with CSS media queries, you should be. Media queries allow developers to apply styles based on the type of device viewing the web page, such as print versus screen, or based on specific characteristics such as viewport width.</p>
            <p>Just imagine, before CSS media queries were introduced, it was well-nigh impossible to create a great online experience on a variety of devices like phones, tablets, laptops, and desktop computers. But these days, CSS media queries make cross-device wizardry a breeze!</p>
            <h2 class="no-wrap">Stay Tuned.</h2>
            <p>We’ll be presenting lots more tips, tricks, and fun stuff regarding CSS media queries in future posts on this site. But for now, this is just placeholder body copy.</p>
